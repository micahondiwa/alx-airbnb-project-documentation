# ALX Airbnb Clone – Backend Documentation

This repository contains the backend system design and documentation for the Airbnb Clone project, developed as part of the ALX Software [ProDev Back-End Developer Program](https://www.alxafrica.com/programme/prodev-backend/). It outlines the features, user interactions, data flows, and technical requirements necessary to implement a robust backend system for a rental marketplace platform.

## Project Overview

The Airbnb Clone backend replicates the core server-side features of a rental marketplace, including:

- User management  
- Listing properties  
- Booking stays  
- Processing payments  

This repository documents the backend logic, workflows, data handling, and system interactions.

## Features and Functionalities

The core backend must support the following functionalities:

- User Authentication (JWT, OAuth)  
- Property Management (Create, Update, Delete Listings)  
- Search and Filter (Location, Price, Guests, Amenities)  
- Booking Management (Date validation, Cancellation, Status)  
- Payments (Secure transactions via Stripe or PayPal, Multi-currency support)  
- Reviews and Ratings (Guests and Hosts)  
- Notifications (Email and In-App)  
- Admin Dashboard (Monitor and manage users, listings, bookings)

## Use Case Diagram

The Use Case Diagram captures the interactions between users (Guests, Hosts, Admins) and the system.

Examples of key use cases:

- Register/Login  
- Create and manage listings  
- Book a property  
- Make payments  
- Leave reviews  
- Receive notifications

Diagram available at: `use-case-diagram/use-case.png`

---

## User Stories

Each use case is translated into a user story. Examples:

- As a guest, I want to register and log in so that I can book properties.  
- As a host, I want to list my property so that guests can book it.  
- As a guest, I want to filter properties by location and price so I can find suitable options.  
- As a user, I want to make secure payments to complete my bookings.  
- As a host, I want to manage reviews on my properties.

Documented in: `user-stories/user-stories.md`

## Data Flow Diagram

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) illustrates how data flows between users, system processes, and storage.

Entities include:

- Users  
- Properties  
- Bookings  
- Payments

Diagram available at: `data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png`

---

## Process Flowchart

The Process Flowchart visualizes the workflow of one core backend feature, such as:

- User Registration  
- Property Booking

Includes steps, validations, and decisions that occur throughout the process.

Diagram available at: `flowcharts/process-flowchart.png`

## Requirements

Technical and non-functional requirements are outlined in `requirements.md`. Key highlights include:

- RESTful API design  
- JWT Authentication  
- Role-based access control  
- Relational database schema  
- Error handling and logging  
- Caching with Redis  
- Automated testing with Pytest  
- Cloud file storage for images
