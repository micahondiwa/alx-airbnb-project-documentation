## Features and Functionalities

The core backend must support the following functionalities:

- User Authentication (JWT, OAuth)  
- Property Management (Create, Update, Delete Listings)  
- Search and Filter (Location, Price, Guests, Amenities)  
- Booking Management (Date validation, Cancellation, Status)  
- Payments (Secure transactions via Stripe or PayPal, Multi-currency support)  
- Reviews and Ratings (Guests and Hosts)  
- Notifications (Email and In-App)  
- Admin Dashboard (Monitor and manage users, listings, bookings)

## Use Case Diagram

The Use Case Diagram captures the interactions between users (Guests, Hosts, Admins) and the system.

Examples of key use cases:

- Register/Login  
- Create and manage listings  
- Book a property  
- Make payments  
- Leave reviews  
- Receive notifications

## User Stories

Each use case is translated into a user story. Examples:

- As a guest, I want to register and log in so that I can book properties.  
- As a host, I want to list my property so that guests can book it.  
- As a guest, I want to filter properties by location and price so I can find suitable options.  
- As a user, I want to make secure payments to complete my bookings.  
- As a host, I want to manage reviews on my properties.

## Data Flow Diagram

The Data Flow Diagram (DFD) illustrates how data flows between users, system processes, and storage.

Entities include:

- Users  
- Properties  
- Bookings  
- Payments

Diagram available at: [data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png](data-flow-diagram/data-flow.png)

## Process Flowchart

The Process Flowchart visualizes the workflow of one core backend feature, such as:

- User Registration  
- Property Booking

Includes steps, validations, and decisions that occur throughout the process.

Diagram available at: [flowcharts/data-flow-diagram.png](flowcharts/data-flow-diagram.png)
